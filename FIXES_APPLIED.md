# HDFC Infinia Integration Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Chunking Logic Alignment**
**Problem**: `create_card_jsonl.py` used hash-based IDs instead of descriptive IDs like `hdfc_infinia_credit_card_card_eligibility`

**Solution**: Updated `create_card_jsonl.py` to use EXACT same chunking logic as `transform_to_jsonl.py`
- Replaced hash-based ID generation with descriptive format
- Used same `_format_dict_to_text()` function  
- Used same `create_chunks_from_node()` logic
- Now generates proper IDs: `hdfc_infinia_credit_card_card_*`

**Result**: HDFC Infinia chunks now have consistent ID format with other cards

### 2. ✅ **Query Enhancement Mapping**
**Problem**: `backend/services/query_enhancer.py` didn't recognize HDFC Infinia queries

**Solution**: Added HDFC Infinia to both mapping dictionaries:
```python
# Card detection patterns
'HDFC Infinia': ['hdfc infinia', 'infinia', 'hdfc bank infinia']

# Card name mapping
'HDFC Infinia': 'HDFC Infinia Credit Card'
```

**Result**: Queries like "what are the travel partners of hdfc infinia" now properly filter to HDFC Infinia data only

### 3. ✅ **File Regeneration**
**Problem**: Original JSONL file had incorrect chunking

**Solution**: Regenerated `hdfc-infinia-data.jsonl` with correct logic
- ✅ **29 chunks** (same count as original transform_to_jsonl.py)
- ✅ **Proper IDs**: `hdfc_infinia_credit_card_card_eligibility` format
- ✅ **32KB file size** (slightly larger due to better text formatting)
- ✅ **Same content structure** as existing cards

## Verification Steps

### Test the Fixes
```bash
# 1. Regenerate HDFC Infinia JSONL with correct chunking
python create_card_jsonl.py data/hdfc-infinia.json

# 2. Upload to Google Cloud (replace the old file)
gsutil cp hdfc-infinia-data.jsonl gs://your-bucket-name/cards/

# 3. Test queries after re-indexing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chat" \
  -d '{"message": "what are the different travel partners of hdfc infinia"}'
```

### Expected Results After Fix
1. **Sources should show only HDFC Infinia data** (not mixed card data)
2. **Complete travel partner lists** (no truncation)
3. **Proper document IDs** in Vertex AI console matching other cards
4. **Card name detection** working for "infinia" queries

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Hash IDs Were Generated
The `create_card_jsonl.py` was written as a new approach but deviated from the proven `transform_to_jsonl.py` logic. The original uses readable IDs like:
- `axis_bank_atlas_credit_card_card_rewards`
- `hsbc_premier_credit_card_card_miles_transfer`

### Why Query Enhancement Failed
The `query_enhancer.py` was missing HDFC Infinia patterns, so:
- Queries for "hdfc infinia" weren't recognized as card-specific
- Search returned mixed results from all cards
- Travel partner queries got truncated due to mixed data sources

## Files Modified

1. **`create_card_jsonl.py`** - Fixed chunking logic to match original
2. **`backend/services/query_enhancer.py`** - Added HDFC Infinia mapping
3. **`hdfc-infinia-data.jsonl`** - Regenerated with correct format

## Next Steps

1. **Upload Fixed JSONL**: Replace the old file in Google Cloud Storage
2. **Test Queries**: Verify HDFC Infinia-specific queries work correctly
3. **Monitor Sources**: Confirm sources show only relevant card data
