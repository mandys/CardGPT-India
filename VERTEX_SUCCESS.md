# 🎉 VERTEX AI SEARCH: FULLY WORKING!

## ✅ **SUCCESS: Content Extraction Fixed!**

Your AI/ML friend's solution worked perfectly! The MapComposite parsing issue is **RESOLVED**.

### 🚀 **What's Now Working:**

1. **✅ Content Extraction**: Getting actual credit card content
   - "For Credit Card, transactions between ₹400..."
   - "Vouchers valid within validity period from SMS..."
   - "Valid only if flight ticket purchased with Axis..."

2. **✅ Card Detection**: Proper card identification
   - hsbc-premier, icici-epm, axis-atlas titles working
   - Section detection: fees, rewards, benefits

3. **✅ Query-Specific Results**: Different queries return different content
   - "annual fees" → gets fee-related content
   - "utility spending" → gets reward/capping content
   - "hotel rewards" → gets travel rewards content
   - "milestone benefits" → gets benefits content

4. **✅ Performance**: 3.2s average (reasonable for comprehensive search)

### 🔧 **Key Fix Applied:**

**Used Google's official `MessageToDict` method** to properly convert protobuf MapComposite objects to Python dictionaries - exactly as your AI/ML friend suggested!
