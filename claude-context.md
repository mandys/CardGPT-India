# Claude Context - Supavec Clone Project

## Project Overview
A modern full-stack RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application for querying Indian credit card terms and conditions. Built as a clone of supavec with enterprise-grade Vertex AI Search. Now features a professional React + FastAPI architecture with responsive design.

## Key Architecture Changes
- **Modern Full-Stack Architecture**: React + TypeScript frontend with FastAPI backend
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with collapsible sidebar and bottom navigation
- **Six main modules**: embedder.py, llm.py, retriever.py, vertex_retriever.py, query_enhancer.py, calculator.py
- **Dual search system**: Vertex AI Search (primary)
- **Multi-model support**: OpenAI (GPT-4/3.5) + Google Gemini (Flash/Pro)
- **Smart query preprocessing** with category detection and model routing
- **Improved calculation logic** for rewards/miles (base rate + milestone bonuses)
- **Token usage optimization** reduced from 3K to 1.2K tokens per query
- **Enterprise reliability**: Google's managed infrastructure with auto-scaling
- **Professional UI**: Complete UI control with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

## Current Working Status
