I want to migrate from a custom RAG implementation to a managed platform like Vertex AI Search as a significant step. 
It involves trading some granular control for a massive boost in power, scalability, and reduced maintenance.

I want a step-by-step plan. This is a big architectural change, and it's important to do it methodically.

First and foremost, your instinct is correct: do not work on your main branch.

Project Setup: Create a New Git Branch
Before you write a single line of code, create a new branch. 
This will isolate these major changes and allow you to switch back to your working application at any time.

Bash

git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/vertex-ai-search-integration
TODO: Migrating CardGPT to Vertex AI Search
This plan is broken into two parts. 
First, we'll set up the necessary Google Cloud infrastructure. Second, we'll modify the codebase to use it.

Part 1: Setting Up the Vertex AI Search Infrastructure
This part is all done within the Google Cloud Console. Vertex AI will handle the chunking, embedding, and indexing for you.

✅ Step 1: Enable the API

Follow the steps I provided previously to ensure the Vertex AI API is enabled in your Google Cloud project.

✅ Step 2: Create a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Bucket

Vertex AI Search needs a place to read your data from. A GCS bucket is the easiest way.

In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Cloud Storage > Buckets.

Click "Create".

Give it a unique name (e.g., cardgpts-source-data-unique-name).

Choose a region (e.g., us-central1) and click "Create".

✅ Step 3: Upload Your JSON Files

Navigate to your newly created GCS bucket.

Click "Upload files" and upload your axis-atlas.json, icici-epm.json, and hsbc-premier.json files into the bucket.

✅ Step 4: Create a Vertex AI Search App & Data Store

This is where the magic happens. You're creating the "search engine" itself.

In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Vertex AI > Search and Conversation.

Click "+ New App".

Select the "Search" app type.

Give your App a name (e.g., "CardGPT-Engine").

Under Data Stores, click "+ Create New Data Store".

Select "Cloud Storage" as your source.

Point it to the GCS bucket you created in Step 2. Select the folder or files.

Leave the other settings as default and click "Create". Google will now start processing and indexing your files. This can take a few minutes.

✅ Step 5: Get Your IDs

Once the Data Store is created, click on it. You will need three pieces of information for your Python code later. Note them down:

Project ID: Your Google Cloud Project ID.

Location: The region you created the app in (e.g., global or us-central1).

Data Store ID: The unique ID for the data store you just created.

Part 2: Modifying the Codebase
Now we'll adapt your application to call this new managed service instead of your custom retriever logic.

✅ Step 1: Install the Google Cloud Library

You'll need the official Python client for Vertex AI Search.

Bash

pip install google-cloud-discoveryengine
✅ Step 2: Create a New vertex_retriever.py File

Instead of modifying retriever.py, let's create a new file src/vertex_retriever.py. This keeps your old logic intact in case you need to revert. This new file will be much simpler.

Python

# In src/vertex_retriever.py

from google.cloud import discoveryengine_v1 as discoveryengine
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

class VertexRetriever:
    def __init__(self, project_id: str, location: str, data_store_id: str):
        self.project_id = project_id
        self.location = location
        self.data_store_id = data_store_id
        self.client = discoveryengine.SearchServiceClient()
        self.serving_config = self.client.serving_config_path(
            project=project_id,
            location=location,
            data_store=data_store_id,
            serving_config="default_config",
        )

    def search(self, query_text: str, top_k: int, card_filter: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict]:
        """Performs a search query against the Vertex AI Search data store."""
        filter_str = None
        if card_filter:
            # Vertex AI uses a SQL-like filter syntax on the document's metadata.
            # Here, we assume you've set 'cardName' as metadata.
            # NOTE: Vertex AI Search doesn't directly handle metadata on JSON fields.
            # A better approach is to upload one JSON per card and set metadata on the file object in GCS.
            # For now, we'll rely on the powerful semantic search.
            # A more advanced filter would look like: `filter = f'cardName="{card_filter}"'`
            pass

        request = discoveryengine.SearchRequest(
            serving_config=self.serving_config,
            query=query_text,
            page_size=top_k,
            filter=filter_str
        )
        response = self.client.search(request)

        # Process the response into the format your app expects
        processed_results = []
        for result in response.results:
            doc = result.document
            # The content is in 'derived_struct_data' for JSONs
            content = doc.derived_struct_data
            processed_results.append({
                'content': str(content), # Convert dict to string for display
                'cardName': doc.name.split('/')[-1], # Example: Extract from document ID
                'section': 'retrieved_from_vertex',
                'similarity': result.relevance_score
            })
        return processed_results
✅ Step 3: Update app.py to Use the New Retriever

This is the main orchestration change. You will swap out the old DocumentRetriever for the new VertexRetriever.

Function to change: initialize_services()

What to change: Remove the initialization of EmbeddingService and DocumentRetriever. Add the initialization for VertexRetriever, pulling the necessary IDs from Streamlit secrets.

Python

# In app.py
from src.vertex_retriever import VertexRetriever # New import

@st.cache_resource
def initialize_services():
    # ... (get api keys)
    project_id = st.secrets.get("GCP_PROJECT_ID")
    location = st.secrets.get("GCP_LOCATION")
    data_store_id = st.secrets.get("GCP_DATA_STORE_ID")

    # embedder = EmbeddingService(api_key) # NO LONGER NEEDED
    llm = LLMService(api_key, gemini_key)
    # retriever = DocumentRetriever(api_key) # OLD
    retriever = VertexRetriever(project_id, location, data_store_id) # NEW
    query_enhancer = QueryEnhancer()
    return llm, retriever, query_enhancer # Note embedder is gone
Function to change: load_and_process_data()

What to change: This function becomes almost obsolete. You no longer need to load JSONs, chunk them, or store them in ChromaDB. You can simplify it to just fetch the available card names for the UI, or remove it entirely.

Function to change: process_query()

What to change: The call to the retriever will now use the new search method. The embedding step is gone.

Python

  # In app.py's process_query function

  # ...
  # The call to embedder.generate_single_embedding is REMOVED
  # ...

  # Call the new VertexRetriever search method
  relevant_docs = retriever.search(
      query_text=question,
      top_k=top_k,
      card_filter=card_filter
  )

  # The rest of the function (calling the LLM) can remain the same!
  # ...
✅ Step 4: Review Other Files

embedder.py: This file is now obsolete for the RAG flow and can be removed from the core logic.

retriever.py: Your old ChromaDB retriever can be kept as a backup or removed from the new branch.

query_enhancer.py & llm.py: These remain crucial and largely unchanged. Your QueryEnhancer is still needed to detect the card_filter, and LLMService is still needed to generate the final answer from the context provided by Vertex AI Search.

By following this plan, you will have successfully migrated the retrieval portion of your application to a powerful, managed, and scalable cloud service.
