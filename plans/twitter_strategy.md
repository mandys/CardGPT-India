## ⏰ Daily Posting Schedule

### **Morning (8-9 AM) - Technical Deep Dive**
Format: Thread (2-5 tweets)
Focus: "Building CardGPT: Lesson #X" series

Example:
```
🧵 Building CardGPT: The Search Evolution

1/ Started with manual text search - slow & inaccurate
Results: 30% relevant answers, users frustrated

2/ Moved to ChromaDB with embeddings 
Better, but maintenance overhead killed productivity

3/ Switched to Vertex AI Search
99.9% uptime, 90% accuracy, zero maintenance

The lesson: Sometimes SaaS > DIY

```

### **Afternoon (1-2 PM) - Quick Tips**
Format: Single tweet
Focus: Actionable insights

Example:
```
💡 Claude Code Pro Tip:

Always use Planning Mode for complex tasks!

❌ "Build me a search system"
✅ Plan → Research specific tools → Execute step-by-step

Result: 3x better architecture, fewer iterations

What's your Claude Code superpower? 🤖

```

### **Evening (6-7 PM) - Reflection & Community**
Format: Single tweet or short thread
Focus: Broader insights, questions, weekly summaries

Example:
```
🤔 After 6 months building CardGPT:

The hardest part isn't the code.
It's deciding WHAT to build.

Every feature seems essential until you realize users only need 20%.

How do you decide what to cut?
