Example:
```
üßµ Building CardGPT: The Search Evolution

1/ Started with manual text search - slow & inaccurate
Results: 30% relevant answers, users frustrated

2/ Moved to ChromaDB with embeddings 
Better, but maintenance overhead killed productivity

3/ Switched to Vertex AI Search
99.9% uptime, 90% accuracy, zero maintenance

The lesson: Sometimes SaaS > DIY

```
ü§î After 6 months building CardGPT:

The hardest part isn't the code.
It's deciding WHAT to build.

Every feature seems essential until you realize users only need 20%.

How do you decide what to cut?
